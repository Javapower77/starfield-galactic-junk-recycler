* [x] BUG: workshop hab of the Dragonfire II the output bin spawns in wrong place
* [ ] Wire spool should break down into copper or something
* [ ] Group break down for plants to nutrients, toxins, etc
* [ ] Find a way that doesn't need 3 objects (Activator and 2 Containers). Keeping all 3 linked ref in ship habs is a disaster.
