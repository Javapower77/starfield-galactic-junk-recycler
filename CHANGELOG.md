# Venworks Galactic Junk Recycler

## Version 3.0.1
- The ModDebug script as unbound got stripped from the final BA2 trying again manually linking the scripts in the platform uploader. 
- Added a consumable named "Fix Junk Recycler" that only shows able to be crafted when you don't the perk enabled.
- Removed the ModDebug helper the way ESL works that can't work you get new IDs ever time your load order changes so doing stuff with IDs is impossible with ESL.

Note: the BGS version of this update is awaiting approval by BGS
