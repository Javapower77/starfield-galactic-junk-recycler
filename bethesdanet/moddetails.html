<b><u>Overview</u></b>
<p>
  Venworks Junk Recycler will break down your old armor, weapons, clothing, books, and junk from your exploration and give you usable resources at any workbench in the game.
  <br>
  We want this to be an option for players that do not like the outpost mining mess and need a way to get the resources you can't from pure exploration.
</p>

<br>
<b><u>Usage</u></b>
<b>Recycling Items</b>
Aim at the workbench you should see a new option recycle (usually bound to R but sometimes space)
<ul>
  <li>Press the bound key for recycle.</li>
  <li>Transfer/Deposit the items you want to recycle into it.</li>
  <li>The broken-down materials are immediately transferred to your inventory.</li>
</ul>
