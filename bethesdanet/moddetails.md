# Overview
Venworks Junk Recycler will break down your old armor, weapons, clothing, books, and junk from your exploration and give you usable resources at any workbench in the game.

We want this to be an option for players that do not like the outpost mining mess and need a way to get the resources you can't from pure exploration.


# Usage
## Recycling Items
Aim at the workbench you should see a new option recycle (usually bound to R but sometimes space)

1. Press the bound key for recycle.
2. Transfer/Deposit the items you want to recycle into it.
3. The broken-down materials are immediately transferred to your inventory.
